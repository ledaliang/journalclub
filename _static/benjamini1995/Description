The paper titled "Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing" 
by Benjamini and Hochberg, published in theJournal of the Royal Statistical Society: Series B (Methodological) in 1995,
introduces a groundbreaking statistical method for addressing the problem of multiple hypothesis testing.
 
The main idea of the paper is to control the False Discovery Rate (FDR) rather than the Familywise Error Rate (FWER),
which had been the traditional approach. 

FWER controls the probability of making at least one false discovery, while FDR controls the expected proportion 
of false discoveries among all the discoveries.

Here's a brief summary of the key points:

Problem Statement: In scientific research and data analysis, researchers often test multiple hypotheses simultaneously,
which increases the risk of making false discoveries. The authors propose an alternative approach to controlling this type of error.
Introduction of FDR: The paper introduces the concept of the False Discovery Rate (FDR), which is defined as the 
expected proportion of false discoveries among all the discoveries. This is a more flexible and practical criterion for controlling errors 
in multiple testing scenarios.

BH Procedure: The authors propose the Benjamini-Hochberg (BH) procedure, which is a stepwise method for controlling FDR. 
It ranks the p-valuesobtained from multiple tests and selects a threshold that limits the proportion of 
false discoveries to a pre-defined level (q-value).

Advantages: The BH procedure is shown to be more powerful than traditional methods (e.g., Bonferroni correction) 
because it can detect more true positives while still controlling the FDR.

Practical Application: The paper provides guidelines and practical recommendations for researchers to implement 
the BH procedure in their own studies. It emphasizes the importance of choosing an appropriate value for the FDR threshold (q-value)
based on the specific research context.

In summary, the paper "Controlling the False Discovery Rate: A Practical and Powerful Approach to Multiple Testing" 
by Benjamini and Hochberg introduces the concept of the False Discovery Rate (FDR) and presents the BH procedure as a practical and 
effective method for controlling FDR in multiple hypothesis testing scenarios. 

This approach has had a significant impact on statistical 
research and data analysis, as it offers a more balanced way to control errors 
while maximizing the detection of true positives.
