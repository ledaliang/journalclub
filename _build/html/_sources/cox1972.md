# Regression Models and Life-Tables
## David Cox 1972

Sir R. Cox's 1972 paper, "Regression Models and Life-Tables," presents a groundbreaking statistical methodology known as the Cox proportional hazards model. 
This model is a fundamental tool in survival analysis, which is widely used in various fields, including epidemiology, medicine, and social sciences.

### Main contributions

* __Introduction to Survival Analysis__: Cox begins by introducing the concept of survival analysis, which deals with the analysis of time-to-event data, such as the time to death or failure. He emphasizes the need for a flexible and versatile statistical model to analyze such data.

* __The Proportional Hazards Model__: The key innovation of this paper is the development of the Cox proportional hazards model. This model is a semi-parametric approach that allows researchers to assess the impact of covariates (independent variables) on the hazard rate (instantaneous failure rate) over time. Unlike traditional survival models, the Cox model does not assume any specific distribution for the survival times, making it highly adaptable.

* __The Hazard Function__: Cox defines the hazard function and explains how it relates to survival probabilities. He formulates the model mathematically, expressing the hazard as a product of a baseline hazard function and an exponential function of covariates.

* __Proportional Hazards Assumption__: One of the key assumptions of the Cox model is the proportionality of hazards. This means that the effect of covariates on the hazard is constant over time. Cox discusses the importance of assessing this assumption and provides methods to do so.

* __Estimation and Inference__: The paper outlines methods for estimating the model parameters using the partial likelihood and provides guidance on hypothesis testing and confidence intervals for the parameter estimates.

* __Applications__: Cox discusses various applications of the proportional hazards model, including its use in medical research to analyze survival times of patients with different treatments or risk factors.

* __Real Data Example__: The paper includes a detailed application of the Cox model to real data from a clinical trial involving cancer patients, demonstrating how to interpret the results and make inferences about treatment effects.

In summary, Sir David R. Cox's paper "Regression Models and Life-Tables" introduced the Cox proportional hazards model, which has had a profound impact on survival analysis and statistics. The model's flexibility and ability to handle censored data have made it an essential tool for researchers studying time-to-event outcomes.
