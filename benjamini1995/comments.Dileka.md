The overarching motivating example involving the Harvard Six Cities was an interesting way to exhibit the power of the methodology.
 It was also helpful to see the history of the approach beginning with the linear model, then explaining its issues along with how they were resolved by growth curves, eventually explaining its issues and how they were resolved by future models and so on. 
My only feedback would be to have gone a bit slower through some of the math and proofs via additional detail whilst hi-lighting the 
main clever ideas in them.
